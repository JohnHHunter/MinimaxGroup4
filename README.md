# MinimaxGroup4

Josh Hayden: Added the evaluation methods and made the NoOpponentCornersPlayer. This method worked best out of all the ones I tested.
It beat spacesControlled as well as weighting corners and edges or just corners every time. Minimax using this evaluation method, with a depth of 2, beat random 80% of the time.
